## Learning
Use [this learning companion PDF](https://learning-pathways.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AI-Learning-Companion.pdf). The boxes in the PDF are clickable with embedded links to the corresponding resource.

- **Columns (left → right):** executive → technical  
- **Rows (top → bottom):** increasing depth of knowledge  

You should go to the [main site](https://learning-pathways.co.uk/) to acquire a refreshed version of the PDF about every **2 to 3 months** (the PDF content is routinely updated).

### Responsible AI first
You must learn about impacts, implications, and risks associated with AI *prior* to using AI, learning about AI tools, model training, etc. The following LinkedIn (+ Microsoft) courses are an excellent starting point to a learning journey of responsible AI that must never end:

- **[Ethics in the Age of Generative AI](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ethics-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?u=0)**
- **[Career Essentials in Generative AI](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-generative-ai-by-microsoft-and-linkedin?u=0)** (by Microsoft and LinkedIn)

### Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn is a valuable resource for learning AI among many other technical categories. Much of the content revolves around real-world applications and currently available tools versus theory and concepts:

## Experiment with generative tools

### Step 1: Adopt an AI-first mindset
Reference: [Allie K. Miller’s “Getting started with AI-first” LinkedIn course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/how-to-use-generative-ai-building-an-ai-first-mindset?u=0).

Every time you want to search for something — anything — use a generative AI tool first. We are used to searching in terms of “7 words or less” and only for things we think will have a high probability of having some sort of results returned.

Generative AI is different, so we must think differently. Instead, think in **sentences** or **concepts** versus “7 words or less.” Search for things you never have thought about searching for before, or never thought you would get a good search result for.

### Step 2: It’s not a search engine
Start to realize that generative AI is not a search engine. It is a creation engine that *generates* responses to your input (prompts).

With that in mind, after practicing “AI-first searching,” start prompting AI tools for more than just search results. Prompt it to generate output for things that are beyond just searching — things that you are currently not in the habit of asking about.

### Verify and use safely
- **Validate** outputs, especially in sensitive or high-stakes contexts.
- **Ask for sources** and cross-check important claims using multiple independent references.
- **Don’t paste or enter private data** (personal, medical, financial, confidential work info). Most general-purpose tools are not private by default.
