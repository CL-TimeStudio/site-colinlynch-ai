## Learning
Use this learning companion PDF. The boxes in the PDF are clickable with embedded links to the corresponding resource.

- **Columns (left → right):** executive → technical  
- **Rows (top → bottom):** increasing depth of knowledge  

You should go to the main site to acquire a refreshed version of the PDF about every **2 to 3 months** (the PDF content is routinely updated).

### Responsible AI first
You must learn about impacts, implications, and risks associated with AI *prior* to using AI, learning about AI tools, model training, etc. The following LinkedIn (+ Microsoft) courses are an excellent starting point to a learning journey of responsible AI that must never end:

- **Ethics in the Age of Generative AI**
- **Career Essentials in Generative AI** (by Microsoft and LinkedIn)

### Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn is a valuable resource for learning AI among many other technical categories. Much of the content revolves around real-world applications and currently available tools versus theory and concepts:

## Experiment with generative tools

### Step 1: Adopt an AI-first mindset
Reference: Allie K. Miller’s “Getting started with AI-first” LinkedIn course.

Every time you want to search for something — anything — use a generative AI tool first. We are used to searching in terms of “7 words or less” and only for things we think will have a high probability of having some sort of results returned.

Generative AI is different, so we must think differently. Instead, think in **sentences** or **concepts** versus “7 words or less.” Search for things you never have thought about searching for before, or never thought you would get a good search result for.

### Step 2: It’s not a search engine
Start to realize that generative AI is not a search engine. It is a creation engine that *generates* responses to your input (prompts).

With that in mind, after practicing “AI-first searching,” start prompting AI tools for more than just search results. Prompt it to generate output for things that are beyond just searching — things that you are currently not in the habit of asking about.

### Ethical and safe use
Validate and ethically use AI-generated content, especially in sensitive or high-stakes contexts. Protect your privacy by not entering private or sensitive data into your prompts. Generally available generative AI tools are not private and therefore you must not enter private data.
